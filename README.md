# News Explorer

**News Explorer** is a fully client-side news discovery and reading application built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to explore top headlines, search for articles by keyword, and filter content by category — all fetched dynamically from a public news API (e.g., NewsAPI.org or similar).

This project is aimed at **developers and learners** who want to understand core web development concepts without the overhead of complex frameworks. It demonstrates real-world use of REST APIs, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/async/await), DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
