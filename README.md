# News Insight

**News Insight** is a lightweight, client-side news exploration app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It fetches the latest headlines from public APIs and allows users to explore, search, and filter news articles across different categories.

This project is aimed at developers looking to understand how to build a fully functional front-end application without using any frameworks. It demonstrates how to work with REST APIs, perform DOM manipulation, and create a responsive layout — all from scratch.
